This repo is designed to be used as an XDG_CONFIG_DIR. Thus, each group of
configurations should live in its own sub-directory

## Setup

- Run setup/setup.sh
- Install iTerm2 from here `https://www.iterm2.com/`
- Enable "Load preferences from a custrom folder or URL" and "Save changes to folder when iTerm2 quits" and target the folder to ~/config/iTerm2 

## Editing tracked files
If a file is stored in the home directory, simply add a copy to this repo (without the leading '.' in the filename) and then add the filename to the file called setup/managed_files.txt on a new line
